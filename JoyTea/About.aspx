    <h2><%: Title %> JoyTea</h2>
    <h3>We dreamt of a place that tea lovers, connoisseurs, and amateurs alike could come together to explore the world of tea. Inspired by pure passion and a respect for authenticity, JoyTea was born.</h3>
    <p>In 2010, JoyTea was birthed out of admiration and absolute love for all things tea. We started by creating unique blends using the finest quality teas and ingredients, after trial and error, tasting and testing our blends were absolutely delectable! We believe tea brings people together, it can bring a moment of calm to your day when you need it, the health properties tea is known for, or a boost of energy during your midday slump… we are firm believers that herbs as medicine are not only powerful, but they also work!
We take pride in our high standard of quality; offering authentic true teas direct from origin, organic exclusives, a broad variety, and our own unique blends- created by innovation and the promise to deliver excellence in serving you our finest products.
We are a team of tea lovers! Our hands are matcha-stained; we drink tea, touch tea, talk tea and study tea- all day. From our founders, to those of us who pack your online orders and greet you at our store front location, we sincerely share your passion for tea and stand behind our product to offer you the best there is.
We thank you for choosing Tealyra, we are honored to serve you, and share our passion for tea and excellence with you!</p>
